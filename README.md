Amazon Headphones Analysis – From Web Scraping to 💻 Power BI Dashboard (Part 2).

Curious to know which headphone brands dominate Amazon? I was too. So I turned that curiosity into a full-fledged data project—from scraping live product data to building a dynamic dashboard that uncovers hidden market trends.

🔍 Using Python with BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape real-time headphone data from Amazon, capturing details like -
Brand,Type (Wired/Wireless),Ratings & Number of Reviews,Original Price,Discounts etc.


🧪 I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean, structure, and extract insights—focusing on brand popularity, pricing strategy, discount effectiveness, and customer engagement.

📊 Finally, I brought the data to life through an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing users to:
Compare brand performance (Boat, JBL, Noise, etc.)
See average ratings and pricing distribution
Analyze discounts vs. actual purchases
Filter and dive into brand-specific behavior
